## What Is Frosty February?

Welcome to Frosty February, an inaugural (first time) event! Which we aim to make a yearly Hackathon event for the Zero To Mastery community. So how does it work?

**There are 6 projects, being led by some of your awesome Star Mentors in the Discord community. Each mentor will spend the month of February leading his or her team to complete the project they have designed to present back to the community on February 29th 2020!**

The goal is to gain experience working in teams, and building something together by the end of the month that you can be proud of and even hopefully put on your resume!

## How To Apply To A Project!

To make the projects manageable, the project teams will be limited in size. To ensure the sign up process is as fair as it can be, collaborators will be required to submit a small application. Each of the project's leaders will be choosing thier team from those that created a submisson. Selections will not be based on experience, the project leaders are looking for passionate and driven individuals that were able to demonstrate in their application how they will contribute to driving the project to completion. 

Ready to apply? Awesome, you can find the [application here](https://forms.google.com)

## New To Opensource Projects

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open source project, we recommend taking a look at our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). This repo has everything you need to learn about open source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR.

## Looking For More Events And Challenges?
We highly recommend checking out the back catalogue of [coding challenges](https://zerotomastery.io/community/coding-challenges/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=frosty-february-hackathon-2021) and [events](https://zerotomastery.io/community/events/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=frosty-february-hackathon-2021). With varying levels of complexity there is something to test and push every skill level. 

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all of our challenges, there is zero benefit or monetary gain we receive from it. This is just our way of extending the classroom and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of the courses.**
