## What Is Frosty February?

Welcome to Frosty February 2021, the 2nd annual ZTM Hackathon! Whether you're a beginner or experienced developer, we have 2 coding projects that you can participate in led by Zero To Mastery Star Mentors. Each mentor(s) will spend the month of February leading their team to complete the project they have designed to present back to the community on February 29th 2021!**

The goal is to gain experience working in teams, and building something together by the end of the month that you can be proud of and even hopefully put on your resume!

## How To Apply To A Project!

To make the projects manageable, the project teams will be limited in size. To ensure the sign up process is as fair as it can be, collaborators will be required to submit a small application. Each of the project's leaders will be choosing thier team from those that created a submisson. Selections will not be based on experience, the project leaders are looking for passionate and driven individuals that were able to demonstrate in their application how they will contribute to driving the project to completion. 

Ready to apply? Awesome, you can find the [application here](https://forms.gle/DRmfroDE2K58KR338)

> ### Main goal 🏁 
>Main goal of this project is to create a new and up-to-date STARTER for a Gatsbyjs blog which gets data from MDX files.
> ### Data sourcing 💿
> A connector for Netlify CMS will be implemented to the starter which makes it easy to fill the blog with awesome posts.
> Because the CMS is configurable as well, more ways to create pages and content will be one of the benfits with this starter. 
> ### But why? 🤔
> The idea was born because the "newest" version of a Gatsby+Netlify CMS starter on the official Gatsby get-started-template page got updated in 2018 which is kind of long time ago.
> Also, a modern css framework should get implemented so that the blog is themable in an easy way via changing the values of a few CSS custom properties (CSS variables).
> ### The feature 🤯
> Of course, the most mind blowing and also important feature will be a DARK MODE toggle switch 😜
